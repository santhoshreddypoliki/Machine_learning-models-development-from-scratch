# Machine_learning-models-development-from-scratch
Diabetes prediction using the Machine Learning models. 

I had made machine learning models from scratch for these projects. 
I had used same dataset for these three models and I also uploaded that file.

I had carried out all the preprocessing tasks like Label_encoding and Standardization in these projects.


I had made these three models from scratch.

1. Linear Regression

2. Logistic Regression 

3. Support Vector Classifier
